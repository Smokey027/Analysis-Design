# Analysis-Design
Analysis and Design Class
# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that I was solving in this project was to use the proper data structure, after analyzing run-time and memory for different data strucutres. After finding the proper datat structure to use I was tasked with developing code that had the ability to sort and print a list of courses in alphanumberic order.
# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach the problem I first had to get an understanding of data structures such as vectors, linked lists, and hash tables. The use of algorithms was also an area that I had to learn and gain an understanding of. Data structures are important to understand how to store and organize sets of data in an efficient and easily manipulated way. The algorithms set the rules for how a problem will be solved and the instructions to follow. The understanding and utilization of data structures and algorithms have allowed my code to be more efficient and perform better.
# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I had many roadblocks throughout the course of this time. As I began learning about data structures I often did not write the most efficient or reusable pseudocode. I had to read through the ZyBooks activities more slowly in certain sections and even re-read some sections. I also used the internet, YouTube and codeacademy as resources to better understand the information.
# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work during this term and project have allowed me to appreciate the process prior to coding and code implemenation. Designing pseudocode for each data structure helped me to visualize each structure and each section of the final project. Working on this project also helped me to write code more optimally and doing it in a real world situation.
# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project has helped me to write better, more readable and adaptable, code with the best standard practices. Working with algorithms and data structures has allowed my code to be more adaptable and easily modified.
